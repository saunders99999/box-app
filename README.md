# AngularJS Trial App

## Overview
Trying out Angular JS

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Start Karma with `npm test`
  - A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome is the default browser, others can
  be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `test/karma.conf.js`
  file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.
